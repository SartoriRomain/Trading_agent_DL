# 🤖 Deep Learning Trading Agent

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project implements a **Deep Learning-based Trading Agent**, designed to analyze and make trading decisions based on historical financial data. The model leverages deep learning techniques to predict market movements and optimize trading strategies.

## 🚀 Features  

### 🔹 **Data Processing**  
- 📊 **Preprocessing of financial market data** (e.g., price history, technical indicators).  
- 🔄 **Normalization and feature engineering** to improve model performance.  

### 🔹 **Deep Learning Model**  
- 🧠 **Neural Network-based approach** for financial market prediction.  
- 🎯 **Reinforcement learning / supervised learning** (if applicable).  
- 🔍 **Evaluation metrics** to assess model accuracy and efficiency.  

### 🔹 **Backtesting & Performance Evaluation**  
- 📈 Simulating trading strategies based on model predictions.  
- 💰 Calculating profits, losses, and risk-adjusted returns.  

### 🔹 **Visualization & Insights**  
- 📉 **Stock price trends and predictions** over time.  
- 📊 **Performance comparison** between the model and baseline strategies.
